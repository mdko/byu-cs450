This is a library for adaptive Huffman encoding, as described by Knuth
in "Dynamic Huffman Coding", Journal of Algorithms vol 6.

A test program 'compact' is compiled by default, which uses the
algorithm to compress and uncompress files.  The driver is very simple
and accepts only the -d flag, and will not use the standard io.  The
-d flag or calling the program under the name 'uncompact' will cause
it to uncompress.  It writes compressed files with a .jz extensions.

The stats2header file takes 3 arguments, infile outfile table_name.
infile is the name of a file containing whitespace separated numbers,
the first being the alphabet size and the rest being the frequency of
each element in the alphabet.

Do not use zero-frequency elements in these stats files, I haven't
accounted for those yet.
